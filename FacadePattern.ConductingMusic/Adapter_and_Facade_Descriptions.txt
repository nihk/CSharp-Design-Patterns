The adapter and facade patterns are similar in appearance, but differ
in their intent. The adapter modifies an interface, for example, to deal with
legacy code. HFDP gave the example of an adapter for an enumeration class based
off of the iterator class. The facade pattern provides a simplified interface
for the client to deal with. This interface will typically call methods
of the facade class's object member variables. This design pattern follows the
Principle of Least Knowledge in order to encapsulate the details of how the
methods are being called.
