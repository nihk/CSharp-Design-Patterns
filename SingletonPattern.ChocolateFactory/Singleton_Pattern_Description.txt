Singleton advantages:

-one and only one instance of the class is ever created
-can delay that creation to only when it's needed (aka lazy evaluation),
 as opposed to, e.g., a static variable in compile time
	-that saves resources
-prevents unforeseen bugs from the alternative -- having a class with just static methods/variables
