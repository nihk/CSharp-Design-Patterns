Observer pattern:

Ch2 of HFDP addresses how to build a weather monitoring app.
A WeatherData object pulls data from a weather station (e.g. an API,
but for this project it's just hardcoded inputs) and pushes it to
different displays. The objective is for the code to be flexible enough
that displays can be added/removed willy nilly.

The solution provided by the book is to write Subject and Observer interfaces
(and a DisplayElement interface, but this isn't essential to the pattern).
The WeatherData class will implement the Subject
interface; this interface, however, is generic enough that any class that 
holds Observers can also implement it. Similarly, any type of class can implement
the Observer interface, so long as its purpose in life is to receive updates from
one Subject.

The Subject to Observer relationship is one-to-many: the WeatherData object will
have an IList member variable that holds Observer objects, and each Observer implementation
will have a single Subject member variable. The WeatherData object has methods to add and
remove Observers from its list of Observers. Any time it changes its three weather-related
member variables (using one SetMeasurements method), a method within this is called
to update every Observer object in its list.

Here are simple steps to how the Subject and Observer implementations relate to each
other through a driver class.

>> Create a WeatherData object
>> Create any number of Observer implementations. Each has a constructor
that passes the same aforementioned WeatherData object.
>> Within that constructor the passed WeatherData object calls its add()
method and adds "this" (the newly created Observer implementation object)
to its List of Observers.
